            <p>My favorite part of school is when our science teacher shows us the Animal of the Day. Our class has learned about all sorts of animals, like monkeys, jellyfish, eagles, and more!
                I hope we get to learn about sharks soon. Animal of the Day has shown me how cool zoology can be!</p>
