This project is a sample landing page for an "Animal of the Day" website, built from CSS and HTML.

The project primarily demonstrates basic CSS tools and skills including common elements (e.g., color, font, and size), the box model (e.g., margin, border, and padding), and flexbox (e.g., alignment, centering, growing/shrinking).
